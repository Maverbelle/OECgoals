  </div><i>Grow our monthly donor program.</i></h2>This will require developing and implementing a monthly donor conversion protocol for new and renewing members. The target is to grow our Evergreen Society to 300 members by March 31, 2016 (currently at 280). Wendy B. is my primary partner in crime for this effort, but I will also rely on Strong OEC and marcom for their support.</p>

    <span class="anchor" id="Goal2"></span>
    <div class="goal2"><p><h2><article class="highlight">Goal 2</article><i> Help supporters and board members become recruiting ambassadors for OEC’s membership program.</i></h2>I will utilize the OEC member network by working with individual supporters to throw OEC house parties. My goal for this FY is three house parties, recruiting at least 4 new members per party and raising a minimum of $1000 per party. At least one party should be outside of the Portland metro area. I will need the support of Teke, Andrea, Chris and relevant program staff for this goal. Additionally, I will need to coordinate with Renew Oregon and their house party efforts.</p>
    </div>
    <span class="anchor" id="Goal3"></span>
    <div class="goal3"><p><h2><article class="highlight">Goal 3</article><i> Further leverage our digital engagement for membership recruitment.</i></h2>This will include having a second successful #GivingTuesday campaign, recruiting 25 new members to the organization and raising $3000 (FY1314: 14 new members, $2200). Other supportive tools include continuing our It’s Your Oregon story series, refining OEC’s Google Ads campaigns, and improving the effectiveness of our action alerts. Simon will be my go-to for most of this, but I will need the input of the fundraising and legislative team as well.</p>

    <span class="anchor" id="Goal4"></span>
    <div class="goal4"><p><h2><article class="highlight">Goal 4</article><i>Learn more about our members’ lives, passions and priorities.</i></h2></p>I will meet this goal through a membership survey, and supportive activities include member lunches, story collection and the It’s Your Oregon story series. The membership survey will be a huge undertaking. I will need volunteers, as well the support of team Strong OEC. My goal is to deploy the survey by October 1 to prime for year-end giving, and I am aiming for statistically significant participation numbers.<p>

    <span class="anchor" id="Goal5"></span>
    <div class="goal5"><p><h2><article class="highlight">Goal 5</article><i>To increase our face-to-face engagement opportunities, both with members, the community-at-large, and communities of color.</i></h2>To achieve this I will need to flush out the Grassroots Action and Information Network work plan, aligning with the Membership Recruitment and Engagement plan. My target date for completing this plan is October 15. Engagement activities should enable significant list-building opportunities, leverage local partnerships and align with a single non-membership call to action. This fiscal year's goal is to engage 100 people in on-the-ground grassroots activities. I aim to have a clear picture of ROI and conversion rates at the end of the FY. The goals outlined in the Membership Recruitment and Engagement plan read as: 8 non-digital action activities a year—at least 2 per year outside of PDX-metro. At least one activity a year should be in close partnership with one of our social justice partners. Of all my goals, goal #5 requires the most support of program staff and Angela. Karen, Simon and Wendy’s support will also be essential to executing.</p>
